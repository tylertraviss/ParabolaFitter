# ParabolaFitter

## History
This was done in an introductary C programming class. I like having this as a reference as it is one of my first projects I was semi-proud of. It's something I would love to look back on. Thanks for taking the time to check it out!

## Purpose
This project allows you to give specific coordinates on the cartesian plain, and will fit a second-order polynomial and extract such data. It uses Cramer's Law, and is written in a .C file.
